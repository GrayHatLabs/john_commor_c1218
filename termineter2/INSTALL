Requirements:
	Python >= 2.6
	PySerial (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/) >= 2.3.1

How To Install Termineter (Windows):
	No installation or modification is necessary.  Start a command
	prompt, navigate to the termineter directory and use python to run
	termineter.py

How To Install Termineter (Linux):
	Installation is recommended, but not required. Run the included
	install.sh script.  It takes a single optional argument as the path

	If using a USB optical probe with an FTDI chip, you may need to load
	and configure the appropriate serial to USB driver in order to use
	the device. The following command will configure the hardware on
	Linux.

	# modprobe ftdi-sio vendor=0xVVVV product=0xPPPP
	
	Where VVVV is the vendor ID and PPPP is the product ID.  These
	values can be obtained from the lsusb command.

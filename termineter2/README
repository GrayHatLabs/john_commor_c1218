== Summary ==
Termineter is a framework written in python to provide a platform for
the security testing of smart meters.  It implements the C1218 and C1219
protocols for communication.  Currently supportted are Meters using 
C1219-2007 with 7-bit character sets.  Termineter communicates with 
Smart Meters via a connection using an ANSI type-2 optical probe with a
serial interface.
